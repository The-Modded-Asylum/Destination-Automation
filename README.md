# Destination-Automation
{WARNING} This pack is currently in a beta stage. Expect many changes!

I, Boqzo1, proudly present to you Destination Automation! This pack is unlike any other that you have played before. For starters, there is a highly customized ore generation that you won't find in any other modpack that that takes advantage of the highly elevated areas created by the Realistic Terrain Generation mod. It also has many addon mods and mods you haven't really used before such as EnderIO Addons, Veinminer Mod Integration, Streams, Hardcore Darkness, and many more! With a full arsenal of both magic and tech mods, the possibilities are endless!
